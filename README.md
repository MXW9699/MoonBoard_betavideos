# Soloproject_MB_betavideos
moonboard beta videos cache

implementing a project to get a collection of beta vidoes from instagram accounts 
for people with dedicated moonboard instagram accounts to post and browse beta videos as it is so hard to find beta videos
it is very hard to look up betavideos for a specific moonboard climb, even though there are so many mb centered insta accounts


**MVP Goals**

**stretch**
log in application with instagram. 
be able to look up a problem and see beta videos from other accounts

be able to look through all of your own beta videos sorted through problems

stretch
**be able to delete and reupload a video**
