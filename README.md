# Soloproject_MB_betavideos
moonboard beta videos cache

implementing a project to get a collection of beta vidoes from instagram accounts 
for people with dedicated moonboard instagram accounts to post and browse beta videos as it is so hard to find beta videos
it is very hard to look up betavideos for a specific moonboard climb, even though there are so many mb centered insta accounts


**MVP Goals**
have users upload/link moonboard problems with video[x]
be able to look up a problem and see beta videos from other accounts [x]
be able to look through all of your own beta videos sorted through problems [x]
instagram scraping to get videos [x]
be able to delete and reupload a video [x]

**stretch**
filtering on grades [partial]
search by users[partial]
show actual problem on board[partial]

responsive towards mobile
rate limiting on api requests
log in application with instagram. 
import all videos based on instagram handle [partial]
better ui

STILL PERIODICALLY WORKING ON THIS....
